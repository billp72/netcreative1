My name is William Pope. I'm a web designer/developer and part-time a tech evangelist. This site was built with an emerging platform called Gatsby. Gatsby makes it a pleasure for developers and designers to build complex websites, stores, blogs and apps because it's built on the popular Reactjs framework. Not only will you get all the advatages of having a slick, single-page application as your main storefront or blog, but all the advantages of having a standard HTML website as well. Gatsby combines app-like sophistication with fast, SEO-friendly HTML to give your customers the best exprience your money can buy. :)
