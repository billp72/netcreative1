My name is William Pope. I'm a web designer/developer and part-time tech evangelist. This site was built with an emerging platform called Gatsby. Gatsby makes it a pleasure for developers and designers to build complex stores, blogs and apps because it's built on the popular Reactjs framework. Not only will you get all the advatages of having a slick, single-page application as your main website with Gatsby, but have all the advantages of standard HTML web pages as well. Gatsby combines app-like sophistication with fast, SEO-friendly HTML to give the customers the best exprience your money can buy. ;)
