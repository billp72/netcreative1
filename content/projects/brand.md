## What constitutes a brand?
A brand is a memorable, comprehensive visual identity that may also include music, sound, and smell depending on the brand. Brand recognition is when people buy products on the basis of the brand alone. Trust in a brand means people feel confident in the consistency and quality of their products. While there's more than one way for gaining trust in your brand, trust is vital for keeping it strong.

Before all their goofy commercials came out, I had never heard of Dollar Shave Club. They were able to develop a brand seemingly overnight, because, I assume, of massive investment in their idea for a low-cost razor subscription plan. People associate ubiquity with trustworthiness because, and in the backs of our minds, we believe thousands, and in some cases, millions, of people couldn't be wrong about a product or company. 

## A few ways to gain trust in the digital era.
While not as sexy as getting a large investment and gaining national recognition, growing your brand using simple methods can be accomplished at first and without giving away equity in your company. Subtly letting your customers know of your return policy throughout the sales process is one easy way to build trust. And providing customers a way to chat with a sales agent to get their questions answered is another way. Likewise, offering convenient ways for customers to pay through web payment technology like Google pay prevents dropped carts. If you can build trust using technology you can build, if not a brand, an efficient sales machine. 

Mirroring the customer service model of a brick-and-mortar store is becoming increasingly important for online stores for gaining trust. The opportunity to serve the customer in an online store will soon exceed even the most well-run brick-and-mortar. Ai technology in the form of customer service chat agents is now available with the potential of wide adoption as costs to implement them come down. Web payment, while probably never replacing traditional credit card payments, are already the preferred choice in many other countries besides the US but with the US primed for mass adoption as well.
