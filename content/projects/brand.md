## What constitutes a brand?
A brand is a comprehensive visual identity that may also include music, sound, and even smell depending on the brand. Brand loyalty means people feel confident enough in the consistency and quality of products under the brand name to buy them based solely on the brand. While there's more than one way for gaining trust and building a brand, trust is vital for any business to stay profitable and steal sales away from those companies that have yet to prove their trustworthiness.

Before all the humorous commercials came out, I had never heard of Dollar Shave Club. And suddenly they were everywhere. They were able to develop a brand around a low-cost razor subscription plan quickly after getting a massive cash investment. People associate ubiquity with trustworthiness because, and in the backs of our minds, we associate fame with trust. 

## A few ways to gain trust in the digital era.
While not as sexy as getting a large investment and gaining national recognition as DSC did, growing your brand using simple strategies can accomplish the same thing for a price that doesn't require you give away equity in your company. Subtly letting your customers know of your return policy throughout the sales process is one easy way to build trust. And providing customers a way to chat with a sales agent to get their questions answered is another way. Likewise, offering convenient ways for customers to pay using web payment technology like Google Pay et al prevents dropped carts and gets repeat business. If you can build trust using technology you can build, if not a brand, an efficient sales machine.

Mirroring the customer service model of brick-and-mortar stores online is the next step in the evolution of web-based stores and one more nail in the coffin for retailers with traditional stores. The opportunity to serve the customer in an online store will soon exceed even the most well-run brick-and-mortar. Ai technology in the form of customer service chatbots is now available with the potential of wide adoption as costs continue to come down. Web payment, while probably never replacing traditional credit card payments completely, is already the preferred choice in many other countries besides the US but with the US primed for mass adoption as well.
