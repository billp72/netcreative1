## What constitutes a brand?
A brand is a total visual identity that may also include sound, and even smell depending on the brand. Brand loyalty means people feel confident enough in the quality of the products to buy them based solely on the brand. While there's more than one way to build a brand, consumer trust is vital.

Dollar Shave Club was attempting to solve the age-old problem of high-cost razor blades by starting a subscription service enabling people to get them at a discount. There was nothing proprietary about what they were doing so they had to flood the market with advertising thereby gaining instant credibility. I don't know what their sales were when they finally sold the brand, but Unilever paid 1 billion dollars for it. 

## A few ways to gain trust in the digital era.
While not quite as sexy as blowing your brand up overnight and receiving a massive offer for it, growing your brand slowly using simple strategies to gain trust can accomplish the same thing. Subtly letting your customers know of your return policy throughout the sales process is one easy way to build trust. The only reason I can think of why merchants don't already do this is out of fear that people will take advantage of it. Or they simply don't take returns. Either way, it's important to let the consumer know so they feel reassured about their purchase. Providing customers a way to chat with a sales agent is another way to start building trust. If your a solo entrepreneur you may not be able to field all questions in a timely matter. However, chatbots quickly replacing humans for tier 1 support. Likewise, offering convenient ways for customers to pay using web payment technology like Google Pay et al prevents dropped carts and gets repeat business. If you can build trust using technology you can build, if not a brand, an efficient sales machine.

Mirroring the customer service model of brick-and-mortar stores online is the next step in the evolution of web-based stores and one more nail in the coffin for traditional retailers. The opportunity to serve the customer in an online store will soon exceed even the most well-run brick-and-mortar.
