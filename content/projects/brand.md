## What constitutes a brand?
If you don't dominate your niche or have huge sales globally, then you don't really have a brand. But if you don't have trust than you don't have sales and you can't build a brand. While there's more than one way to develop a brand, gaining trust is vital for keeping your brand strong once you have it. I had never heard of Dollar Shave Club before their goofy commercials came out. They were able to develop a brand nearly overnight it seemed, because of massive investment in their idea for a low-cost razor subscription program. If you have an idea as strong as they did, you too can probably get an investment as well. But if you don't, don't fret, because there are other ways to gain trust, albeit not as glamorous. 

## A few ways to gain trust in the digital era.
While not nearly as exciting as writing a commercial featuring a Gen-Xer making smug comments while riding a forklift through a warehouse, keeping customers informed of your return policy throughout the sales process along with providing a sales chat box to answer questions are a couple of ways to build trust in your online store. Likewise, offering convenient ways for customers to pay also engenders trust and prevents dropped carts. If you can build trust using technology you can build a brand.Mirroring the 

customer service model of a brick-and-mortar store is becoming increasingly important for online stores. The opportunity to serve the customer in an online store will soon exceed even the most well-run brick-and-mortar. Ai technology is now available with the potential of wide adoption as costs to implement it come down. Web payment, while probably never replacing traditional credit card payments, are already the preferred choice in many other countries (China being one) other than the US but with the US primed for mass adoption as well.
