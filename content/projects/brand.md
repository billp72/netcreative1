## What constitutes a brand?
A brand is a complete visual identity that may also include sound, and even smell depending on the brand. Brand loyalty means people feel confident enough in the brand name to buy its products without worrying about quality. The only way to buld brand loyalty is to build trust. 

Dollar Shave Club could have built a trusted brand but instead decided to sell it Unilever who already had a trusted brand and other things going for them. There was nothing proprietary about what DSC was doing so had to flood the market with advertising thereby gaining instant credibility. I'm not sure what their sales were when they finally did sell, but Unilever paid 1 billion dollars for the company.

## A few ways to gain trust in the digital era.
While not quite as sexy as blowing your brand with expensive advertising and receiving a massive offer, growing your brand slowly using simple strategies to gain trust may accomplish the same thing. Subtly letting your customers know of your return policy throughout the sales process is one easy way to build trust. A few reason why merchants don't already do this is out of fear that more people will take advantage of the policy if it's well-known. Or they simply don't take returns and don't want to advertise it. Either way, it's important to let the consumer know so they feel reassured about their purchase. Providing customers a way to chat with a sales agent is another way to start building trust. If your a solo entrepreneur you may not be able to field all questions in a timely manner. Luckily, chatbots are available to assume tier 1 support in your absence. The price to implement this technology will vary. Likewise, offering a variety of convenient payment methods, like Google Pay, prevents dropped carts and gets repeat business. If you can build trust using technology you can build, if not a brand, an efficient sales machine.

Mirroring the customer service model of brick-and-mortar stores online is the next step in the evolution of web-based stores and one more nail in the coffin for traditional retailers. The opportunity to serve the customer in an online store will soon exceed even the most well-run brick-and-mortar.
