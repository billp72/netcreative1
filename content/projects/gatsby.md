### WHAT IS GATSBY?
Put simply, Gatsby is a modern, Javascript alternative to site tools like Wordpress. Along with Gatsby, I also use Contentful as the CMS and Netlify to host my sites. [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

### WHY SHOULD PEOPLE KNOW ABOUT GATSBY?
Wordpress has dominated the CMS market for a long time. But with advancements in Javascript, I feel Wordpress is due for some competition. I also feel Gatsby is a superior platform in many ways. [Gatsby Starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2)

### WHY SHOULD I COMPLICATE THINGS BY USING A SEPERATE CMS?
When you rely on one platform for both page creation and content management, ala Wordpress, you're locking yourself into that platform. Switching now becomes an arduous process of migrating your data to a new platform if you ever decide to change. Keeping your content in the cloud means you never have to worry about it.

### WHAT ABOUT PERFORMANCE?
According to benchmark testing, Gatsby outperforms Wordpress and other platforms when page load times were compared. I will say, both PHP and JS are making strides towards better performance.

### WHAT ABOUT SEO?
Without getting too technical, Gatsby renders static HTML pages directly to the browser which are then easily indexed by web crawlers. All things being equal, there's no reason a Gatsby site shouldn't rank similar to a Wordpress site on Google. I might even give a slight edge to Gatsby simply for its speed.

### WHAT ARE THE DOWNSIDES?
Tools like Wordpress are far easier for a layman to use. Gatsby, on the other hand, definitely needs to be developed by a developer. And if the goal is to get a website up yourself, and you're not particularly technical, you might want to try Wix. Parenthetically, just because a Wix site can be gotten up easily, doesn't mean you won't need to spend money on web design. -shameless plug inserted.
