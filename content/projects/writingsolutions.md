## PROJECT BACKGROUND/PROBLEM
To develop a website for an English translation business. I agreed to do the work in exchange for translation services of my international shopify customers.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
The website would allow customers to upload documents that needed translation either from Chinese to English or English to chinese and let them check the quality of the work before they paid.

## NECESSITIES
Make it easy for users to see both their original documents and the translated documents side-by-side on the site<br />
Create a homepage that is both contemporary but still has oldfashioned aesthetic appeal<br />
Estimate time to completion.
<br />
## OUTCOME
Upon successful completion of the design and prototype, it has been approved for development
