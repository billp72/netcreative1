## PROJECT BACKGROUND/PROBLEM
This site was designed in lieu of translations services for my brother&apos;s company in Taiwan. 
As compensation for the work, he is willing to proofread Shopify stores translated into Chinese for my customers.

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
To develop a website for an English translation business

## NECESSITIES
Make it easy for users to see both their original documents and the translated documents side-by-side on the site<br />
Create a homepage that is both contemporary but still has oldfashioned aesthetic appeal<br />
Estimate time to completion.
<br />
## OUTCOME
Upon successful completion of the design and prototype, it has been approved for development
