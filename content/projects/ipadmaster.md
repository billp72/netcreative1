## PROJECT BACKGROUND
The original website was not responsive

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
Make the site suitable for mobile screens

## NECESSITIES
Decide if there should be a complete redesign or if fixing the original site was perfered<br />
Inventory all images and other content to determine what could be reused<br />
Make sure all appropriate metadata and tags are added to pages for accessibilityÂ and SEO<br />
Estimate time to completion.
<br />
## OUTCOME
While the site was successfully made responsive, I believe a new, better, site could have been built for roughly the
same money
