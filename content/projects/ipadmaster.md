## BACKGROUND / PROBLEM
The original website was not responsive

## OBJECTIVE
Make the site suitable for mobile screens

## STEPS
<ul class="li-style">
<li>Design what the mobile screens should look like in Photoshop<br/>
<li>Refactor CSS such that sizes are inherited from a base size using rem and em values</li>
<li>Change, where necessary, margin to text-align, float, flex, or position to help content reflow for mobile</li>
<li>Add and adjust media queries for content on mobile screens as needed</li>
<li>Make all appropriate metadata and tag changes to new and existing pages for accessibilityÂ and SEO</li>
</ul>

## OUTCOME
While the site was successfully made responsive, I believe a new, better, site could have been built for roughly the
same money
