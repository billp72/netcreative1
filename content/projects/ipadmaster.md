## PROBLEM
The original website was not responsive

## BUSINESS OBJECTIVE
Redesign the site for mobile screens

## PROCESS
Decide if there should be a complete redesign or if fixing the original site is perfered<br />
Inventory images and other content and decide what could still be used<br />
Make sure accessibility and other tag metadata was added to all content and pages<br />
Estimate time of completion.
<br />
## OUTCOME
While the project was successfully completed, I think a new site could have been built for roughly the
same money
