## BACKGROUND / PROBLEM
The original website was not responsive

## OBJECTIVE
Make the site suitable for mobile screens

## NECESSITIES
<ul class="li-style">
<li>Decide if there should be a complete redesign or if fixing the original site is perfered</li>
<li>Inventory all images and other content to determine what could be reused<br/>
<li>Make all appropriate metadata and tag changes to new and existing pages for accessibilityÂ and SEO</li>
<li>Estimate time to completion.</li>
</ul>

## OUTCOME
While the site was successfully made responsive, I believe a new, better, site could have been built for roughly the
same money
