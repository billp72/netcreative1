## PROJECT BACKGROUND
The original website used older technology and a design that felt antiquated

## PROJECT OBJECTIVE
Redesign the entire site using Wordpress

## NECESSITIES
Choose a suitable Wordpress template to start building on<br />
Based on this template, create a site layout which included customizations to the global header/footer, navigation, internal page content (images and text), widgets and deep links<br />
It is extremely important in the pharmaceutical industry for websites to be handicap accessible (WAI-ARIA)<br />
Estimate time to completion.
<br />
## OUTCOME
Upon successful completion of the project, the site saw a 20% increase in traffic driven by the decision to go with an entirely new look and feel.
