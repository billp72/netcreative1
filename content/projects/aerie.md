## OBJECTIVE
Redesign the entire site using Wordpress

## STEPS
<ul class="li-style">
<li>Choose a suitable Wordpress theme to start building on</li>
<li>Based on this theme, create a site layout including customizations to the global header/footer, navigation, and internal pages as needed</li> 
<li>Check images, text, widgets and deep links to makes sure all are working</li>
<li>Test websites for handicap accessibility (WAI-ARIA)</li>
<li>Estimate time to completion.</li>
</ul>

## OUTCOME
Upon successful completion of the project, the site saw a 20% increase in traffic driven by the decision to go with an entirely new look and feel.
