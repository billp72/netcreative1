## BACKGROUND / PROBLEM
The original website used older technology and a design that felt antiquated

## OBJECTIVE
Redesign the entire site using Wordpress

## ROLE
UI design and development

## STEPS
<ul class="li-style">
<li>Choose a suitable Wordpress theme to start building on</li>
<li>Create a site layout including customizations to the global header/footer, navigation, and internal pages as needed</li> 
<li>Implement features, continuing to check that nothing else around the site had broken</li>
<li>Make a final check of the site functionality while adding small design corrections before handoff</li>
</ul>

## OUTCOME
Upon successful completion of the project, the site saw a 20% increase in traffic driven by the decision to go with an entirely new look and feel.
