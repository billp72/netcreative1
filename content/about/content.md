# How many years have you been building websites?
10 years ago I was a designer - print and some web. Three years after that, I started my developement career

# Why the change from design to development?
I felt a nagging urge to know more about the technology I was designing for

# What do you like best about your work?
The excitement of having to learn ever-changing technology

# What are your hobbies
I work out at the gym; I play guitar and bass; I write stories and, believe it or not, I actually do coding as a hobby

# What would you do if you weren't a developer?
Probably retire from whatever it was I was doing to pursue my hobbies

# If you could be any other kind of animal, what would it be?
A Wolverine, I suppose
