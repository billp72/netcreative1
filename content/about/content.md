# How many years have you been building websites?
10 years ago I was a designer - print and some web. Three years after that, I started my developement career

# Why the change from design to development?
I felt a nagging urge to know more about the technology I was designing for

# What do you like best about your work?
The excitement of having to learn ever-changing technology

# What sort of projects have you worked on?
Lots of Javascript projects with a smattering of Wordpress as well. PHP 7.4 is out and I've heard good things about it.

# If you could be any other kind of animal, what would it be?
A Wolverine, I suppose
