# How many years have you been in this business?
I started as a web and print designer 10 years ago and three years later, started my developement career

# Why the change from desgin to development?
I felt a nagging urge to learn more about the tech I was designing for

# What do you like best about your work?
The excitement of having to keep up with ever-changing technology

# What are your hobbies
Working out at the gym, playing my guitar or bass, writing stories and, believe it or not, coding

# What would you do if you weren't a developer?
Probably retire from whatever I was doing

# If you could be another kind of animal, what would it be?
A Wolverine, I suppose
