```
# How many years have you been building websites?
10 years ago, I was a web and print designer. Three years went by before I started my developement career

# Why the change from desgin to development?
I felt a nagging urge to know more about the technology I was designing for

# What do you like best about your work?
The excitement of having to learn changing technology

# What are your hobbies
I work out at the gym; I playing guitar and bass; I writing stories and, believe it or not, I actually do some coding as hobbie

# What would you do if you weren't a developer?
Probably be retired from whatever it was I was doing

# If you could be any other kind of animal, what would it be?
A Wolverine, I suppose
